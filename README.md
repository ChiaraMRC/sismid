# Pathogen evolution, selection and immunity

Short course taught by [Sarah Cobey](http://cobeylab.uchicago.edu/) and [Trevor Bedford](http://bedford.io/) for [SISMID 2015](https://depts.washington.edu/sismid/general.html).

## Description
This module provides an introduction to modeling antigenically diverse pathogen populations. 
Complementary ecological and evolutionary approaches will be covered and their relationships emphasized. 
The first part of the course will introduce multistrain compartmental models, review mechanisms of competition, and derive conditions for coexistence.
Results from these simple models will be contrasted with those of agent-based models with more complex assumptions (e.g., multiple forms of immunity, spatial structure, and host age).
We will review how models of competing pathogens can be fitted to longitudinal data from individuals and time-series data of cases from populations.
The second part of the course will show how, using the coalescent as a neutral expectation, selective pressures and pathogen population structure can be measured from sequences.
Methods to measure pathogen phenotypic similarity and antigenic evolution, such as antigenic cartography, will be introduced.
The course will use dengue, HIV, pneumococcus, and influenza as model systems, and we will also discuss how future models may be informed by growing information on individual antibody repertoires.
Assumes material from Module 2 (Mathematical Models of Infectious Diseases).
