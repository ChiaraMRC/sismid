# Pathogen evolution, selection and immunity

Short course taught by [Sarah Cobey](http://cobeylab.uchicago.edu/) and [Trevor Bedford](http://bedford.io/) for [SISMID 2015](https://depts.washington.edu/sismid/general.html).

## Description
This module provides an introduction to modeling antigenically diverse pathogen populations. 
Complementary epidemiological and evolutionary approaches will be covered and their relationships emphasized. 
The first part of the course will review mechanisms of competition and introduce multistrain compartmental models.
Results from these simple models will be contrasted with more complex agent-based models.
We will review how models of competing pathogens can be statistically fitted to longitudinal data from individuals and time-series data from populations.
The second part of the course will show how, using the coalescent as a neutral expectation, selective pressures and pathogen population structure can be identified from sequence data.
We will go over bioinformatic methods to work with sequence data and build phylogenies.
Methods to measure pathogen phenotypic similarity and antigenic evolution, such as antigenic cartography, will be introduced.
The course will use dengue, HIV, pneumococcus, and influenza as model systems, and we will also discuss how future models may be informed by growing information on individual antibody repertoires.
Assumes material from Module 2 (Mathematical Models of Infectious Diseases).
Material from Module 14 (Evolutionary Dynamics and Molecular Epidemiology of Viruses) would be helpful, but not required.
